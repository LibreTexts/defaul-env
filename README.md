# default-env

At the moment, this contains two default Jupyter environments.

* **Minimum Default** contains all requested packages,
with only a Python environment.
* **Rich Default** contains all the requested packages,
with the Python, R, Julia, Octave, and Sage environments.

**repo2docker** contains our attempt to use repo2docker to generate
a Docker image. It failed to install packages in the root environment.
Kept as a reference for now.
